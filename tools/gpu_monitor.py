gpu_monitor.py -- DGX Spark (GB10) GPU sampler, driven by gpu_monitor.timer.

One invocation = one sample:
  * util / temp / power  via `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=...`
  * GPU memory + procs   via `nvidia-smi --query-compute-apps=...`
    (GB10's memory.used query returns [N/A] -- never rely on it)
  * appends ONE compact line to ~/gpu_monitor_log.txt
  * writes ONE report file to ~/gpu_reports/
 * self-prunes ~/gpu_reports/ older than REPORT_KEEP_D days
 * samples MemAvailable / MemFree / PSI from /proc and runs the unified-memory
 * guard: when allocatable memory drops under the floor (or GPU memory passes
 * the ceiling) on two consecutive samples, SIGTERM the top GPU consumer and
 *   escalate to SIGKILL after a grace period.  See the GUARD_* block below.
 * counts NV_ERR_NO_MEMORY lines the kernel log gained since the previous
 *   sample -- literal evidence the driver is refusing allocations.  Joins
 *   the breach set with the normal two-sample confirmation, so a lone
 *   transient refusal recovers instead of killing.  Technique credited to
 *   MiaAI Lab's memwatch.sh (AGPL-3.0-or-later,
 *   github.com/MiaAI-Lab/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-Single-DGX-Spark);
 *   reimplemented from scratch, no code taken.
 * stall guard: the engine's own log silent for STALL_QUIET_S while the GPU
 *   is pegged (>= STALL_UTIL_PCT) means the engine stopped making progress
 *   with memory still healthy -- the signature the box hard-locked from on
 *   2026-10-24/25, which no memory floor ever saw.  Snapshots the engine's
 *   tail, SIGTERMs the engine, escalates to SIGKILL after STALL_GRACE_S, and
 *   keeps a rolling copy of the engine tail in ~/gpu_engine_tail.txt (a hard
 *   lock loses the engine log's unflushed buffer as NUL padding).
 *   GPU_MONITOR_STALL_GUARD=0 disarms it.
    (2026-09-20 fix: old build wrote an unbounded report every run -> 1.45 M
    files / 5.7 GB; also old regexes matched the May nvidia-smi layout and
    logged only N/A ever since)

Failure mode: if every GPU query fails the sample line still lands (all N/A)
but exit code is 1 -> systemd Restart=on-failure retries in 60 s.
Never use Restart=always with a script that exits 0 immediately: it becomes
a hot self-restarting loop.

This unit uses Restart=always + RestartSec=10 to get a ~10 s sampling cadence;
gpu_monitor.timer's 30 min OnUnitInactiveSec never fires because the service
never stays inactive that long.

# --- unified-memory guard (2026-10-24) --------------------------------------
# GB10 has ONE memory pool: the GPU allocates from the same DRAM the CPU
# uses, and the NVIDIA driver does not charge those pages to the allocating
# process's cgroup (maya holds ~90 GiB while its cgroup reports ~4 GiB).  A
# cgroup MemoryMax therefore cannot see this coming -- only the real
# MemAvailable reading can.  When the driver runs out of pages,
# _memdescAllocInternal returns NV_ERR_NO_MEMORY and its error path
# deadlocks: the box hard-locks with nothing on the console, and since the
# kernel watchdog is disabled ("NMI not fully supported") it has to be
# power-cycled.  Cheaper to kill one server than to lose the whole uptime.
#
# MemFree is NOT a usable trigger: the kernel pins it at ~1.2 GiB by design
# and pushes everything else into page cache.  MemAvailable is the kernel's
# own estimate of what is allocatable without swapping.
#
# Two consecutive breaches inside GUARD_CONSEC_S are required, so a
# transient dip never costs a running server.  GPU_MONITOR_GUARD=0 disarms
# the whole thing without editing this file.
#
# THE SIGNAL THAT MATTERS IS DEVICE-FREE, NOT MemAvailable.  On GB10 the
# driver allocates GPU memory out of the same DRAM the CPU uses, so when the
# engine has taken 115 of 119.7 GiB the OS still reports a comfortable
# MemAvailable (~20 GiB, mostly page cache) while the driver is in fact a
# couple of GiB from NV_ERR_NO_MEMORY.  nvidia-smi and NVML both answer
# [N/A] for memory.total/used/free on this part, and the engine prints its
# own "N MiB of VRAM free" exactly once (glm_pack_generate runs a single
# time), so cudaMemGetInfo through ctypes is the only cheap live source.
# Measured: ~0.3 s and ~170 MiB of device memory per call, released at once.
#
# DEVICE_FREE_FLOOR_MIB 3072 sits above the engine's own "LOW" warning
# (256 MiB) and above the ~1021 MiB the box was at when it hard-locked.

# --- stall / liveness guard (2026-10-25) -------------------------------------
# The guard above answers "is the box about to run out of device memory".
# It cannot see the failure the box has actually hard-locked from three
# times (2026-10-24 19:40, 2026-10-24 21:08, 2026-10-25 17:11): the engine
# stops making progress while the GPU stays pegged at 94-95%, with
# device-free still healthy (7-15 GiB), the driver refusing nothing, and the
# kernel log silent to the last line.  On GB10 device memory IS system RAM
# and the kernel watchdog is disabled, so a GPU-side fault takes the whole
# box with it and no userspace watchdog can save it -- but a hang that is
# still only the ENGINE (host-side deadlock, stuck copy lane) is
# recoverable, and in both cases the evidence worth having is the engine's
# own last output, which dies with the box.
#
# So: watch the file the engine actually writes to (its own stderr fd --
# /proc/<engine>/fd/2, the same inode the "[maya] ..." progress lines land
# in; fd 1 is a pipe to the server and is skipped).  When that file has been
# silent for STALL_QUIET_S while the GPU is at STALL_UTIL_PCT or more, treat
# it as a stall: snapshot the engine's tail, SIGTERM the engine, escalate to
# SIGKILL after STALL_GRACE_S.  The launcher restarts the engine on the next
# request, so a false positive costs one restart -- and the threshold sits
# well above the longest legitimate silent stretch there is (one
# 32768-token prefill chunk, ~46 s, with the chunk stage line silenced;
# normally the launcher prints a progress line every 10 s).
#
# An idle engine is silent by design, which is why the utilization gate and
# not the silence alone is what arms this.  A rolling copy of the engine's
# tail is kept on every sample regardless (gpu_engine_tail.txt): after a
# hard lock it is the only record left of what the model was doing, since
# the engine's own log loses its unflushed buffer as NUL padding.

         useful when the cudaMemGetInfo probe is unavailable.
      4. PSI memory full avg10 at/above PSI_FULL_FLOOR for two consecutive
         samples - the kernel saying allocation is already stalling.

         sample - the driver literally refusing an allocation.  Arms like
         any breach; the two-sample confirmation still applies, so one
         transient refusal that the engine retried past recovers.

    Victim: a GPU-pool breach (1, 3 or 6) kills the top GPU consumer, as
    before -- with 2026-10-25 growth attribution first, since on GB10 the
    pool IS system RAM and an RSS hog can cause (1) and (6) without holding
    any GPU memory.  An OS-side-only breach (2, 4, 5) picks the biggest-RSS
    process instead (see _os_victim), because the offender there often
    holds no GPU memory.
